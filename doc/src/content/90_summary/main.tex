Investigated and assessed constraint enforcement options in Kubernetes, with special focus on the admission webhooks.

Designed and implemented a DSL for describing constraints in Kubernetes, by providing
The DSL provides a structured and efficient means for expressing and managing constraints, contributing to overall system robustness.

I designed and implemented a domain specific language capable of describing constraints

I designed and implemented a framework for developing and and deploying contraints.

I demonstrated the final framework in a true to life case study

I evaluated my work and compared it to other solutions.
