\subsection{Agent startup}

The second outside interaction is required to spawn the agent. To spawn an agent, the user must send an HTTP Post request to the `/api/v1/servers/\{dslId\}/start' endpoint of the Core server. The \ref{fig:start1} figure shows how the service layer of the Core server handles the request.
